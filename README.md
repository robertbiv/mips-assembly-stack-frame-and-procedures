# CMPSC 313 Homework 4

MIPS assembly programs for complex numbers, rational numbers, and big integers.

## Files

- `complex.asm` - complex number operations
- `rational.asm` - rational number operations  
- `bigInteger.asm` - big integer operations

## Running

Open each file in MARS and assemble/run. Follow the prompts.

### complex.asm
Enter the real and imaginary parts as decimals when asked.

### rational.asm  
Enter integers for numerator and denominator. Don't use 0 for denominator.

### bigInteger.asm
First enter 0 for positive or 1 for negative.
Then enter digits one at a time (like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 for the number 12345).
Enter -1 when done entering digits.

## Notes

Uses standard MARS syscalls. Make sure to run in MARS simulator.
